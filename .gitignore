# --- DATA EXCLUSION RULES ---

# 1. IGNORE large conflict files (UCDP dataset exceeds GitHub 100MB limit)
data/raw/conflicts/*.csv
data/raw/conflicts/GEDEvent*.csv

# 2. IGNORE Excel files (often temporary or duplicates)
*.xlsx

# 3. Note: Raw commodities (Gold, Oil, Gas) in 'data/raw/commodities/' 
# are intentionally NOT ignored so they can be pushed to GitHub.

# Keep folder structure even if folders are empty
!data/.gitkeep
